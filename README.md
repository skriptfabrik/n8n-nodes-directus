## Development

This project uses the official n8n-node CLI tool for development and follows n8n community node standards.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+**
- **npm 10+**
- **Directus instance** for testing (cloud or self-hosted)
- **ngrok** (for webhook testing) - install from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/skriptfabrik/n8n-nodes-directus.git
cd n8n-nodes-directus

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

### Quick Start

1. **Start n8n with your node loaded**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev:n8n
   ```

   This will:
   - Link your custom node to n8n
   - Start n8n development server
   - Make your Directus nodes available in n8n

2. **Access n8n**: Open http://localhost:5678 in your browser

3. **Configure credentials**:
   - Add your Directus API credentials
   - Test the connection

4. **Create workflows**: Use the Directus nodes in your workflows

### Testing

#### Webhook Testing (Requires ngrok)

For testing the **Directus Trigger** node, you need to expose n8n via a public URL since Directus cannot reach localhost:

1. **Install ngrok** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   # macOS with Homebrew
   brew install ngrok

   # Or download from https://ngrok.com/
   ```

2. **Start n8n** (in one terminal):

   ```bash
   npm run dev:n8n
   ```

3. **Start ngrok** (in another terminal):

   ```bash
   ngrok http 5678
   ```

   This will give you a public URL like `https://abc123.ngrok-free.dev`

4. **Create a webhook workflow**:
   - Add a **Directus Trigger** node
   - Configure the trigger (resource, event, collection)
   - Activate the workflow
   - Copy the webhook URL from n8n

5. **Update Directus webhook**:
   - In Directus, go to **Settings → Flows**
   - Find the created flow and edit it
   - Replace `localhost:5678` with your ngrok URL
   - Save the flow

6. **Test the webhook**:
   - Create/update items in Directus
   - Check if the webhook triggers in n8n

**Note**: The manual URL replacement step is required because Directus cannot reach localhost URLs directly.
